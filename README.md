## Usage

* Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
* Start the project: `npm start`

## What I'm proud of

* Multi-page React application with two pages - one showing a list of movies and one showing details, using React Router.
* Follow the design from given example
* How to pass information such as product ids, or blog post titles in the url and pick this up in React router to load dynamic content.
* Use React hooks, Router, Browserrouter and switch together with useState and useEffect.
* The use of placeholders in urls to pick dynamic parts from urls
* The use of APIs in React - combining `useState` with `useEffect`

## Next step

* Develop more information about every single movie by fe. adding a link to the teaser
* Adding more pages with music and tv-shows
